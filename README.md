# Week-9
Honeypot
Deployed only honeypot 1 that was setup from assignment.

There really weren't any issues that I faced. I would say the only issues I had were small and were setup related. The issues were also errors from typo's in the command line. The only real issue I had was at the end trying to download the json file from the command, it wouldn't do it so I had to look through the google dashboard and download the file manually. 

It was a collection of IP addresses and port numbers that were attacked. I ended up with 2648 total attacks, many of these were from my scan with nmap from another machine using Kali linux. I do not believe I encountered any malware attacks through this assignment.
